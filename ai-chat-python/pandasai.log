You are already provided with the following functions that you can call:
<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What is the average salary of the employees?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

<function>
def execute_sql_query(sql_query: str) -> pd.Dataframe
    """This method connects to the database, executes the sql query and returns the dataframe"""
</function>


Update this initial code:
```python
# TODO: import the required dependencies
import pandas as pd

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY
 What is the average salary of the employees?

At the end, declare "result" variable as a dictionary of type and value.


Generate python code and return full updated code:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 What is the average salary of the employees?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT AVG((CAST(REPLACE(SUBSTRING(salary_range, 2, POSITION(' - ' IN salary_range) - 2), ',', '') AS INTEGER) + CAST(REPLACE(SUBSTRING(salary_range, POSITION(' - ' IN salary_range) + 3, LENGTH(salary_range)), ',', '') AS INTEGER)) / 2 ) AS average_salary

"""
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
average_salary = df['average_salary'][0]
result = {'type': 'number', 'value': average_salary}
print(result)

However, it resulted in the following error:

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what is the highest paying job?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """
SELECT title, MAX(salary_range) as highest_salary
FROM table_58f736f4660b5245abc4e786ee4542b1

df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
highest_paying_job = df.iloc[0]['title']
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f'The highest paying job is {highest_paying_job}.'}

However, it resulted in the following error:

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY

sql_query = "SELECT * FROM table_58f736f4660b5245abc4e786ee4542b1 WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING(salary_range, 2, POSITION(' - ' IN salary_range) - 2) AS INT) > 100000"
high_salary_jobs = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': high_salary_jobs}

However, it resulted in the following error:

Update this initial code:
```python

# Write code here

# Declare result var: 
type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY

type (possible values "string", "number", "dataframe", "plot"). Examples: { "type": "string", "value": f"The highest salary is {highest_salary}." } or { "type": "number", "value": 125 } or { "type": "dataframe", "value": pd.DataFrame({...}) } or { "type": "plot", "value": "temp_chart.png" }

```



### QUERY

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 what job has the highest salary?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = 'SELECT title, MAX(salary_range) as max_salary FROM table_58f736f4660b5245abc4e786ee4542b1'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
highest_salary_job = df.loc[0, 'title']
result = {'type': 'string', 'value': f'The job with the highest salary is {highest_salary_job}.'}

However, it resulted in the following error:

 what job has the highest salary?

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = """

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
sql_query = "SELECT * FROM table_58f736f4660b5245abc4e786ee4542b1 ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING(salary_range FROM POSITION('-' IN salary_range)+2) AS BIGINT) DESC LIMIT 1"
top_job = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
result = {'type': 'dataframe', 'value': top_job}

However, it resulted in the following error:

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sql_query = 'SELECT location, COUNT(*) as job_count FROM table_db8eeec3c0758a8cbde45d83c401e7e7 WHERE location IS NOT NULL GROUP BY location ORDER BY job_count DESC LIMIT 3'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
df['location'] = df['location'].astype(str)
plt.bar(df['location'], df['job_count'])
plt.xlabel('Location')
plt.ylabel('Number of Jobs')
plt.title('Jobs by Top 3 Locations')
plt.savefig('exports/charts/temp_chart_c98d558f-9979-4b70-bdcd-b1d241686893.png')
result = {'type': 'plot', 'value': 'exports/charts/temp_chart_c98d558f-9979-4b70-bdcd-b1d241686893.png'}

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY
 show me chart of jobs for 3 locations with most jobs

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sql_query = 'SELECT location, COUNT(*) as job_count FROM table_db8eeec3c0758a8cbde45d83c401e7e7 GROUP BY location ORDER BY job_count DESC LIMIT 3'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
data = df.set_index('location').T.to_dict('records')
plt.bar(data[0].keys(), data[0].values())
plt.title('Number of Jobs for Top 3 Locations')
plt.xlabel('Location')
plt.ylabel('Number of Jobs')
plt.savefig('exports/charts/temp_chart_bf4e6af2-58c1-45de-b33c-0827c3279137.png')
result = {'type': 'plot', 'value': 'exports/charts/temp_chart_bf4e6af2-58c1-45de-b33c-0827c3279137.png'}

The user asked the following question:
### QUERY

You generated the following Python code:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sql_query = 'SELECT location, COUNT(*) as job_count FROM table_db8eeec3c0758a8cbde45d83c401e7e7 WHERE location IS NOT NULL GROUP BY location ORDER BY job_count DESC LIMIT 3'
df = execute_sql_query(sql_query)
locations = df['location'].values.astype(str)
job_counts = df['job_count'].values
plt.bar(locations, job_counts)
plt.title('Number of Jobs for Top 3 Locations')
plt.xlabel('Location')
plt.ylabel('Number of Jobs')
plt.savefig('exports/charts/temp_chart_eb4e80f8-3867-4c5c-9d29-4f5010f8270e.png')
result = {'type': 'plot', 'value': 'exports/charts/temp_chart_eb4e80f8-3867-4c5c-9d29-4f5010f8270e.png'}
